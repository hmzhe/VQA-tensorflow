# VQA-tensorflow-tensorlayer

This is a tensorflow/tensorlayer implementation for VQA, MLP+Image-Question-Coattention, model.
The MLP part is explained in the 
training a deeper LSTM and normalized CNN Visual Question Answering model. 
The current code can reach same accuracy with original torch code on Open-Ended 
(use COCO train set to train and validation set to evaluation). 
You can check original torch edtion from VQA_LSTM_CNN for more details.
